\chapter{Contributions to the Practical Course Microservice2Go}

M2Go (Microservice2Go) is a practical course,
which supplements the lecture WASA1 (Web Applications and Service-oriented Architectures 1)
offered by the research group Cooperation \& Management (C\&M) each winter semester.
The lecture WASA1 covers the development and architecture of advanced web applications
that employ microservices and the cloud. M2Go supplements the lecture by applying the learned concepts
from the lecture to a concrete example for which microservices are
implemented using the GoLang programming language. The course will be offered each winter semester
starting with the winter semester of 2023/2024. During my bachelor's thesis, I contributed
to the preparation of this course by creating master solutions to exercises for students.

\section{Description of the Practical Course Microservice2Go}

M2Go is split into four different parts which are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:m2go_parts}.
The first part, C\&M Org, familiarizes the students with the working processes of C\&M.
Each student has a timesheet in which they track the amount of time that they spent on the practical course.
The students also create a practical thesis document which is kept in the document storage of C\&M.
The practical thesis document is written throughout the practical course and documents the tasks
carried out by students and what they learned. It is the main basis for their final grade.
The status message is a simple email from a student to the C\&M team to signal that they completed
their tasks for the week and that their practical thesis document as well as the timesheet are in order.

In the GoLang part, the students are introduced to the GoLang programming language.
They start by setting up their M2Go Environment for developing applications with GoLang.
This is then used to create the first program called HelloWorld to get familiar with the programming language.
The goal of this program is to output the text ``Hello World!'' to the console which is a standard first program
to develop when learning any new language.
Afterward, the program CarRental is developed which validates if a date is valid.
This program teaches the students the fundamentals of GoLang like control structures
and unit testing. Based on the program CarRental, CarRentalCLI is developed.
This program provides a basic command-line input (CLI) to interact with a microservice
called CarRental from a C\&M research project. CarRentalCLI does not interact with a real
microservice but instead provides a local version of the service which is implemented by the students.

The Microservice Engineering part teaches students how to develop microservices.
The development process being used is the Unified Microservice Engineering (UME) approach from C\&M.
The microservices that will be developed for this part stem from the Proof of Concept (PoC) BestRentalPoC.
Based on the UME approach, the needed microservices are first analyzed and designed.
Following the design, the microservices are then implemented and tested using GoLang by employing
the knowledge which was gained in the previous part.

Identity and Access Management is the final part of M2Go. It covers the topic of access management
for BestRentalPoC by using decentralized identities and fine-grained authorization.
While this part is currently planned, it is not yet ready.

There are four actors in M2Go as seen in Figure \ref{fig:m2go_actors_and_systems}.
The M2GHead owns the M2Go course as well as all of its materials and templates.
The M2GHead is responsible for the course.
The M2G Practical Material is stored in the C\&M Document Storage.
It is prepared by the M2GOrganizer.
The M2GOrganizer also creates the Working Folder Template which is used to
create the Working Folder for the M2GParticipants. The working folder
contains the sources and current version of an M2GParticipant's Practical Course Thesis.
The Practical Course Thesis is written in Overleaf and is based on the C\&M Thesis Template.
The M2GOrganizer also creates GitLab Templates for the different parts of the course.
The templates are used to create the GitLab repositories for the current semester's course.
M2GParticipants store their solutions to the exercises in the corresponding GitLab repository.
Finally, there is also the M2GSupervisor who supervises and assists M2GParticipants.
The M2GHead and M2GOrganizer are responsible for grading each M2GParticipants participation in the course.
My role in the preparation of this course was that of an M2GOrganizer who creates
the master solutions to the exercises. Because the course is currently being prepared and not
yet offered, I was not responsible for any grades.

As a part of my bachelor's thesis, I contributed to the M2Go course.
My contributions were focused on the third part of the course: Microservice Engineering.
This part amongst other things focuses on the development of a domain microservice called
DM-Car. Together with a student who participated in the WASA2 practical course in 2023,
I implemented the master solution for DM-Car. The master solution is a complete
implementation of the microservice according to the guidelines and best practices of C\&M.
Additionally, I created exercises for the participants 
based on this master solution.

% TODO: Add description of DM-Car's structure

% Before:
% - What is DM-Car -> maybe in the section above

% What are my contributions:
% - Created master solution for DM-Car -> reference Lachenicht
% - Created implementation exercises for DM-Car

% \subsection{Creating the Master Solution for DM-Car}

% What did I do here?
% - Added database connection
% - Refactor
% 	- added operationId to API Specification
% 	- renamed methods to fit API Diagram
% 	- use Cars instead of []Car
% 	- added PORT env
% - Adding tests

The initial implementation of the master solution for DM-Car was provided
by Mr. Lachenicht, a student participating in WASA2's practical course in
the summer semester of 2022. His implementation used an in-memory database
to store cars. My first task was to exchange the in-memory database
with a connection to a Postgres database.
To connect to a Postgres database the microservice needs a connection URL
for that database. The format of that connection URL is 
postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME, where USER and PASSWORD are the credentials
of an account registered with the database. HOST and PORT are the URL where the
database can be reached and NAME is the name of the database.
This connection URL could be hard coded into the microservice which would mean that it
is not configurable. To make the connection URL configurable, the microservice
gets the values needed for the connection URL from environment variables.
The environment variables used for this are the following:
DB\_USER, DB\_PASSWORD, DB\_HOST, DB\_PORT and DB\_NAME.

\section{Implementation and Local Deployment of DM-Car}

The UME approach uses C\&M's micro architecture to implement microservices.
The micro architecture is split into three layers: API, logic and infrastructure.
The source code for each part is placed into a folder with a corresponding name.
The API layer contains the controller, the API specification and stubs which handle the mapping
of HTTP requests to Go methods.
The controller contains the methods which are mapped to the API of the microservice.
The logic layer contains the domain logic which consists of the domain models and the operations.
For each method that is exposed in the API there is a separate operation which is called by the controller
when the corresponding API method is invoked. Because of this one-to-one relation, each operation
implements exactly one domain function.
The infrastructure layer contains the persistency entities, mappers between persistency entities and domain models
as well as the persistency interface.
Persistency entities are a representation of domain models which is used for persisting them in a database.
The persistency interface, also called a repository, contains methods for interacting with the database.
Each operation in the logic layer may be composed of several different methods from the infrastructure layer,
depending on the needs of the operation.

TODO: insert micro architecture diagram or repo figure

A large part of DM-Car has already been implemented but it currently misses two functions.
Firstly, no method has been implemented to add cars.
Secondly, DM-Car currently uses an in-memory database instead of an actual database.

The goal of the implementation phase for DM-Car is to finish the implementation of the microservice and switch to an actual database.
For the database, a Postgres (TODO: link) database will be used.
Additionally, DM-Car requires tests to ensure that its domain constraints will not be violated.

% TODO: Abeck überzeugen wieso API vor Logic
\subsection{API}

For the implementation of DM-Car the web framework Echo (TODO: link) is used.
The task of the web framework for DM-Car is accepting requests,
routing them to the right methods and sending responses.
Because both Echo and OpenAPI are widely used, there is a tool that automatically
generates all the needed source code for Echo to implement an OpenAPI specification.
To generate the right source code without any need for adaptation,
the API specification needs to be as complete as possible. Some of features
of OpenAPI, which are necessary for code generation, are:
Defining data models and giving each API method an operationId which is a unique name.
The data models will be used by Echo to parse incoming JSON requests
into Go structs. The operationId gives the code generator hints for assigning method names
in the generated Go source code.
The UME documentation contains a Best Practice article on how to do all of this. (TODO: maybe link? wahrscheinlich)
