\chapter{Overall Concept of the Developed Solutions}

\todo{Add chapter introduction}

% In this first result chapter of the thesis the overall concept which clarifies the relationship of the investigated issues is introduced.
% From this overall concept all further result chapters and the solutions covered by each of these chapters should be derived.

% \section{BestRentalPoC}

% The \Gls{BestRentalPoC} is a proof of concept for the usage of decentralized identities.
% \Gls{BestRental} is a fictive car rental company, which requires customers to have a valid driver's license
% when renting a car.
% For this purpose, the driving license authority can issue a customer, called Alice, a verifiable credential (VC).
% The VC is stored in Alice's digital wallet.
% When renting a car, \Gls{Alice} can present her VC to BestRental, who can then verify the validity of Alice's driver's license.

% The \Gls{BestRentalPoC} consists of three parts: The \Gls{BestRental} application, the DrivingLicenseAuthority application
% and the decentralized identity system.
% The \Gls{BestRental} application allows \Gls{Alice} to rent a car and present her VC.
% The DrivingLicenseAuthority application allows the issuance of a VC to Alice.
% Finally, the decentralized identity system provides the functionality of issuing and verifying VCs.

% The \Gls{BestRental} application consists of a browser-based frontend and a microservice, which handles the required
% business logic. In the same way, the DrivingLicenseAuthority application consists of a frontend and a microservice.
% Additionally, both applications have tenants in Microsoft Azure which include an Azure Active Directory and
% a Key Vault called VerifiedIDVault.

% The decentralized identity system consists of Microsoft Entra Verified ID and the Trust System called DidWeb.
% This proof of concept utilizes Microsoft Entra Verified ID to implement decentralized identities.
% Entra provides all services which are required for this. This includes services to issues and to verify VCs.
