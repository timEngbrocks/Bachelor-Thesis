\chapter{Overall Concept of the Developed Solutions}

% In this first result chapter of the thesis the overall concept which clarifies the relationship of the investigated issues is introduced.
% From this overall concept all further result chapters and the solutions covered by each of these chapters should be derived.

\section{Monitoring BestRental}

\subsection{Monitoring Targets}

The Demonstrator for BestRental includes multiple types of resources.
These can be grouped into internal and external resources.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Microsoft Application: External
    \item Service: Internal
    \item Cluster: Internal
    \item Azure Tenant: External
    \item Azure Resource Group: External
    \item Azure Directory: External
    \item Service (Principal): External
    \item Trust System: External
    \item Trust Resolver: External
\end{enumerate}

For the collection of metrics from external Microsoft Azure resources, the service Azure Monitor can be used.
This service allows the export and import through a REST API.
