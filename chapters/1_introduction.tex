\todo{Add chapter introduction}

% The following sections suggest an outline proposal for a first chapter of a bachelor/ master thesis written
% by Cooperation \& Management (C\&M) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).  

\section{Introduction to the Topic Area}
% If the work is based on a concrete project scenario, this project scenario should already be introduced
% in this section at a high level of abstraction.

\todo{Introduce topic area}

\section{Research Questions}
% The first research question should be superior to the following questions ''2 to n'' 
% and should be dealt with in the first content chapter which is Chapter 4.

\todo{Come up with research questions}

% The second research question concerns the concrete software system which serves as a (first part of a)
% demonstrator for the overall research question. This software system will be developed in cooperation with
%  the project team (JuniorStudents) which is co-supervised by the author (SeniorStudent) of this thesis.
% Chapter 5 (Technical Foundation) introduces the existing preliminary work which particularly includes the already
% existing artifacts relevant for the software system to be developed. Chapter 6 (First Solution) describes the
% structured development approach of the software system (in the case of a microservice-based application,
% this is C\&M's microservice engineering approach).

% Research questions 3 to n should then be addressed in the following chapters.
% These research questions should be formulated in detail only AFTER clear answers to the second research question have
% been worked out since these results have a strong influence on the further alignment of the thesis.

\section{Description of the Demonstrator}
% The demonstrator should clarify the research questions introduced in the previous section on an appropriate conceptual level.
% The demonstrator introduces a practical example and shows a solution. In its first draft,
% it corresponds to the software system which is developed in cooperation with the co-supervised project team (JuniorStudents).

\section{Thesis Structure}
% \label{sec:gliederung}
% This chapter illustrates the structure of the work in the form of the chapter structure.
% The following chapter structure is recommended:

\todo{Explain thesis structure}

% \subsection*{Chapter 2: Foundations}
% This chapter contains information necessary for a basic understanding of the thesis.
% The information is presented as ''value-free'' as possible.

% \subsection*{Chapter 3: State of the Art}
% The results of the Top Literature are an essential part of this chapter. The structure described in the introduction can be recalled here.

% In contrast to Chapter 2, the contents of this chapter are presented in an argumentative and evaluative form.

% \subsection*{Chapter 4: First Content Chapter}
% Chapters 4 to 4+n are the conceptual contribution chapters of the work in which the achieved results are described.

% \subsubsection*{Chapter 5: ...}

% \subsubsection*{Chapter 6: ...}

% \subsection*{Chapter 5+n: Project Team Work}
% The second last chapter contains the results of the project team work.
% The chapter also describes events (e.g. Coding Day, visits to institutes) in which the person working on this thesis has participated.

% \section{Content-related Overview}
% The overview should describe the most important topic dependencies by means of an illustration.

% \section{Further Information}
% \textit{This section provides various notes on language conventions, formatting, or other technical aspects.
% Therefore, this section must be removed before completing the Bachelor's/Master's thesis.}

% \subsection{Inserting PowerPoint Figures}
% Images are exclusively created with PowerPoint in the image document which should contain all figures in the order of their
% appearance in the thesis document. The title of the slide in the thesis figures file document should correspond to the title of
% the figure in the thesis document. The thesis figures file is saved as .png in the Overleaf folder ``figures''.

% Inserting and referencing the figure is done by a reference: Figure \ref{fig:the_fig_fil_pro}.

% \begin{figure}[h]
% 	\centering
% 	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/the_fig_fil_pro.png}
% 	\caption{Thesis Figures File Process}
% 	\label{fig:the_fig_fil_pro}
% \end{figure}

% The steps of the process described in Figure \ref{fig:the_fig_fil_pro} should be carried out by each JuniorStudent
% and SeniorStudent when creating the initial version of the thesis document.
