\section{Analysis of and Contributions to the C\&M Literature}

% In this chapter the (about 3 (BT) / 6 (MT)) publications with a high relevance for the thesis are described.
% Publications which do have no or only a weak relationship with the thesis should not be part of this chapter.
% The C\&M LITERATURE is the source and destination of all literature work at C\&M.

\subsection*{A Survey on Observability of Distributed Edge \& Container-Based Microservices \cite{UF+22}}
% This is the textbook on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) written by the DDD founder, Eric Evans.
% Core parts covered by this textbook can be found in those parts of the WASA course units \cite{CM-W-WAS}
% dealing with the design of web applications.
% It should be noticed that Evans developed the DDD concept in 2003 independently from the microservices
% which only came up about ten years later (for this reason the textbook is not grouped into this category).
